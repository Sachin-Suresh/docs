Containerization, for all its efficiencies, often brings additional overhead when it comes to managing Kubernetes clusters. Keeping up with infrastructure needs and resource deployments can be a major effort as environments grow.

Numerous tools have risen in response, promising to help you manage growing complexity. Among these, you may have seen Terraform and Helm as options for making life with Kubernetes clusters easier.

So, what sets these two tools apart? How do they compare, and which one should you use?

This tutorial aims to answer those questions. Through an overview of the two tools and a comparison of their roles, the guide gives you everything you need to decide between them.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC lets developers provision environments through code, rather than manually. Often, this can save immense amounts of time. And Terraform stands out as one of the foremost IaC options.

As an IaC, Terraform is able to stand up servers, create virtual machines, and deploy container solutions. Terraform also has the ability to manage users and user permissions and security schemes.

One feature that sets Terraform apart is its use of a declarative language for provisioning environments. Developers do not need to script environment setup, which can be time consuming and difficult to maintain. Instead, Terraform's code has developers state the intended results. Terraform handles realizing them.

Another draw for Terraform is that it is cloud-agnostic. Most of its competition, like AWS CloudFormation and Google Cloud Deployment Manager, only operate in particular cloud environments — AWS and Google Cloud, respectively, for these examples. Terraform, by contrast, can work with any virtually cloud environment.

### Key Features

- Set up and manage servers, virtual machines, and containers all using more maintainable declarative code.

- Configure and maintain security schemes, users, and user permissions for your infrastructure.

- Simplify the process of modifying and/or enhancing infrastructure, allowing you to more easily adjust to developing needs.

- Understands software relationships, making it easier to monitor them and potentially reduce errors.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Declarative language for configuring infrastructure, letting you declare the desired state instead of scripting the steps to get there.

- Immutable infrastructure that replaces servers rather than modifying them, which simplifies maintenance.

- Kubernetes provider to smoothly and easily provision and maintain Kubernetes clusters.

Cons:

- Does not support beta objects, which can hinder you from working with certain resources on Kubernetes clusters.

- Relatively young Kubernetes provider that is still being refined.

## What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Using Helm Charts, developers can package files and templates for applications and services. Helm can then convert your Charts to Kubernetes manifests and deploy them to Kubernetes clusters.

Helm uses a client-server architecture. A Tiller server lives on the Kubernetes cluster and interacts with the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources. Developers can then use Helm's command-line client to interact with the cluster via the Tiller server.

Helm stands out for letting developers deploy and manage Kubernetes manifests across multiple environments. In fact, it makes it possible to deploy Kubernetes packages to multiple Kubernetes environments simultaneously, from a single command.

Pair that with Helm's ability to package even complex applications for ready deployment, and Helm comes out as an excellent choice for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

### Key Features

- Deploy and maintain Kubernetes resources across multiple environments. Helm can even deploy to multiple environments simultaneously with a single command.

- Package applications into convenient bundles, simplifying deployments even for complex Kubernetes applications and services.

- Efficient methods for rolling back and upgrading Kubernetes resources.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Use of a Tiller server gives full access to the Kubernetes API and allows for effective management of run-time resources.

- Has a robust and easy-to-manage system for rollbacks.

- Provides access to a repository of pre-built Helm Charts for a range of applications and services, making it easy to add them to your cluster.

Cons:

- Additional, and relatively complex, tool for working with Kubernetes clusters.

## Terraform vs Helm

Both Terraform and Helm can be used to make life easier when working with Kubernetes clusters. But each is a different tool for a different job. Take a look here to see what each tool excels at and the role it can play in managing your clusters.

Terraform, being an IaC tool, can be used to stand up Kubernetes clusters. Its recent addition of a Kubernetes provider gives Terraform an added edge in putting together and managing a Kubernetes cluster.

But Terraform does not operate inside of the cluster. Recall that Terraform is all about managing infrastructure. So, it can create and manage Kubernetes clusters, but it does not interact with anything that goes on within these clusters.

Helm, on the other hand, is a Kubernetes package manager. It gives you tools for deploying manifests and managing Kubernetes resources on Kubernetes clusters. Helm Charts allow you to craft Kubernetes packages that can then be deployed as applications and services on a cluster.

As such, Helm's purview ends at the boundaries of the cluster. It operates entirely within Kubernetes clusters, and it does not have the capacity to manage the setup and management of the clusters themselves.

## What is Best: Helm vs Terraform?

Like you saw in the previous section, each of these tools plays a particular role when it comes to working with Kubernetes clusters. So you might be wondering which one is right for you? Which one is best for your setup?

Here is a brief overview of which tool you should use when. It reiterates the points made about each tool in the previous section:

- Use Terraform if you need a tool for putting infrastructure in the hands of developers and lowering the effort for provisioning environments. Terraform should be your tool of choice for standing up Kubernetes clusters and preparing and managing environments.

- Use Helm when you need a tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes resources or when you need to be able to package complex Kubernetes applications. Helm helps you when it comes to creating, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications and services. It is especially useful when these applications and services get complex.

### Using Helm and Terraform Together

Terraform and Helm serve in different roles when it comes to Kubernetes clusters. So, it also makes sense to think about how you could use the tools together, each complimenting the other.

What follows is an outline of how Helm and Terraform could be made to work in conjunction for your Kubernetes clusters. This is not the only way, but represents a common approach and gives you an idea of their capabilities.

- Use Terraform to plan out and build your team's infrastructure. Terraform's Kubernetes provider gives you an effective tool for provisioning your cluster. In addition, Terraform includes a Helm provider that can even set up initial states for your Helm applications.

- Terraform then stands as your tool for managing that infrastructure. As you applications scale or their environmental requirements change, use Terraform's declarative configuration to put the necessary changes into effect.

- Use Helm to plan out and execute deployments within the cluster. Package your Kubernetes applications and services using Helm Charts. Helm then provides you with an effective means of rolling out your applications and services across the infrastructure, regardless of their complexity.

- Helm becomes your resource for managing your Kubernetes applications and services. Its smoothed-out process for rolling out Kubernetes manifests can help you whenever you need to deploy new or updated resources.

One caveat to using Helm and Terraform together, however: Doing so does complicate your work. The combination leaves developers working to manage both a tool for infrastructure and a tool for Kubernetes application deployments.

But this approach can be a good choice for complex environments where both infrastructure and deployments need to be able to scale and adapt to developing needs.

## Conclusion

You should now have what you need to make a choice between Terraform and Helm. Or, as this guide has shown, to make the decision to use them both in tandem. This guide has shown what makes each tool stand out and how they stack up next to each other.
